            Hi, my name is Ankith Deekollu. I am currently working as a Project Manager and Business Analyst at Mass Technologies.
            Through OSU I am currently enrolled and working in a Fullstack Coding Bootcamp looking to further my career into software development.
            I have 5 years of work experience in the finance industry specifically in the insurance industry with New York Life and 21st Century Financial.
            I graduated from The University of South Wales with a B.A in Accounting and Finance. I love to play tennis and rock climb on my freetime or anything outdoors like hiking.
